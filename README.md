# Rock vs Mine Prediction (Sonar Data)

## 📌 Project Overview

- This project applies Logistic Regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm, to classify objects detected by sonar as either rocks (R) or mines (M).
- The Sonar Data Set consists of 208 samples with 60 features, each representing the strength of sonar signals. Logistic Regression was chosen for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks and interpretability.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Language: **Python**

- Libraries: **NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook**

## 🚀 Steps in the Project

- Load and explore dataset
- Preprocess data (train-test split)
- Train model using Logistic Regression
- Evaluate model performance (accuracy score)
- Make predictions with new input values

## 📊 Results

- The Logistic Regression model achieved good accuracy in classifying sonar signals.

- Demonstrated reliable generalization to unseen data.
